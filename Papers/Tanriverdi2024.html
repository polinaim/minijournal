                        In our day-to-day lives, we experience rapidly changing environments cluttered with information of all types. 
                        Just as when you have too many tabs open in Google Chrome, this information can have big implications on performance.
                        Within vision, this performance reduction can be seen as a worsened ability to perceive objects accurately. 
                        In cluttered environments, this can impede our ability to recognise specific objects. This phenomenon is known 
                        as ‘visual crowding’, and it’s most impactful within outer regions of vision, or peripheral vision. For 
                        instance, <b><em>Figure 1</em></b> gives a nice demonstration of visual crowding at play. When looking 
                        straight at the target in the centre of the image, it is much easier to notice the child on the right of 
                        the screen, who is in the open, rather than the child surrounded by road signs. This example shows how 
                        crowding can play a role in daily tasks such as driving.
                    <p><br>

                        </figure>
                        Whilst visual crowding is not an issue for most individuals, it can become of concern for those experiencing 
                        certain visual or brain-related deficits. Namely dyslexia, schizophrenia, nystagmus, macular degeneration and
                        glaucoma (1). In such individuals, crowding effects are more pronounced, and can negatively impact day-to-day life. 
                        It can lead to issues in reading speeds for dyslexic individuals (2), and issues in face recognition for individuals 
                        with glaucoma (3).
                        These challenges highlight the need to increase our understanding of visual crowding, so we can tailor current 
                        treatments and diagnoses towards these issues. Such would be a welcomed change, as currently there is a heavy 
                        reliance on time-consuming and attentionally demanding techniques. This reliance on demanding techniques becomes 
                        an issue when assessing certain patient groups who tend to struggle under conventional psychophysics techniques 
                        (4). Conventional techniques typically involve presenting a visual stimulus and expecting a response which can 
                        become over-demanding due to prolonged focus on singular objects, or even too many repetitions/responses needed.

                    <p><strong>The problem</strong><br>
                        Have you ever tried to find a friend in a packed area and failed? That’s visual crowding in action – 
                        when the surrounding clutter makes it hard for you to pick out specific details. For example, people with dyslexia might find it harder to read, 
                        and those with glaucoma might have trouble recognizing faces.
                        However, current methods for assessment of visual crowding are too complex and impractical for regular clinical use, making accurate diagnosis challenging.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><strong>How did they try to solve it?</strong><br>
                        This study aimed to find quicker, easier and more accurate ways to measure visual crowding by introducing two new methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eye Movement Response: Instead of pressing buttons or using a mouse, participants simply use their eye movements to indicate what they see.</li>
                        <li>Adaptive Psychophysics: This method adjusts the difficulty of the test based on the participant’s performance. If someone is doing well, the test becomes more challenging; if they’re struggling, it gets easier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Key outcomes</strong> 
                    <p>
                        Using eye movements or quick serial searches to test for visual crowding could be a faster and still reliable way to assess this issue. 
                        It might make things easier for routine checks, but further tests are needed to see how well these methods work with different groups of people and specific needs.

            <div class="intro-container-temp">

                    <p><br>
                        Our study aims to solve the aforementioned issues. We will investigate visual crowding to find a more intuitive 
                        and efficient method of testing for crowding effects, which is also suited for patient groups. If successful in 
                        this goal, we can provide a more effective method of assessing early indicators of visual impairment in various 
                        disorders. In turn, this can allow for necessary treatment to be given at an earlier stage, due to earlier diagnosis. 
                        One of our main ideas in reaching this goal is to move towards a task employing eye movement analysis. Whilst eye 
                        tracking gives a range of metrics surrounding visual functioning, we mainly want to implement eye tracking as a 
                        response mechanism. This would replace the need for a manual ‘button press’ typically seen in traditional approaches. 
                        Instead, participants would make a ‘saccade’ (rapid eye movement) towards a target, indicating a response. We believe 
                        this implementation of eye movements will allow for a freer and more natural experience for participants. Another way 
                        we aim to improve on traditional methods is by reducing the number of repetitions needed. As mentioned, psychophysical 
                        experiments typically require large amounts of repetition to gain necessary information. However, in our study, we will 
                        employ an adaptive psychophysics approach where the experiment dynamically changes difficulty based on an individual's 
                        performance on the task. This is a clever approach which allows for fewer repetitions to collect necessary information, 
                        thus reducing the overall length of the experiment.   
                    <p><br>
                        Ultimately, our primary focus is to develop an innovative, efficient, and adaptive psychophysics task to measure visual 
                        crowding. To investigate the effectiveness of using eye movement responses, we aim to introduce different ‘visual search’ 
                        paradigms to either promote continuous eye movement responses or not. A ‘serial search’ paradigm will be implemented to 
                        promote eye movements, whilst a ‘parallel search’ paradigm will be implemented to minimise eye movements. These paradigms 
                        are a part of ‘visual search’ which denotes the methods used to analyse a visual environment. ‘Serial search’ is an 
                        inefficient searching mechanism requiring individual inspection of objects to find the target, usually adopted in situations 
                        where an object of interest doesn’t stand out from its background. On the other hand, ‘parallel search’ is a more efficient 
                        mechanism which compares multiple objects at once, and is adopted when an object does stand out from its background. By 
                        employing a ‘serial search’ paradigm in our study, we can be more sure that continuous eye movements will be present since 
                        all objects will likely be searched independently.

            <h2>Methods (Optional)</h2><br>
            <strong>Participants</strong> 
            <p>The study involved 15 healthy adults aged between 19 and 32.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>•	Screen and Computer: The experiments were done using a monitor and a MacBook Pro with MATLAB software to run the experiments.</li>
                <li>•	An eye tracker (a device that records where you're looking) to monitor where participants were looking during the experiment.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Test Paradigm</strong></p>
            <p>•	Gabor Patches: The main visual elements used were Gabor patches, which are blurry, stripey patterns often used in vision research. Sometimes the target (the pattern participants needed to find) was shown by itself, 
                and sometimes it was surrounded by other similar patches (called "flankers") to create a crowding effect, making it harder to identify the target.</p>
            <img src="../images/gabor-patches.png" alt="Gabor patches" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            <p>•	Manipulating Difficulty: The difficulty of the task was adjusted by changing the angle of the stripes in the Gabor patches. 
                The more the stripes were tilted, the easier it was to identify the target. The researchers also varied the similarity between the target and the surrounding patches to see how it affected the crowding.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Task Variations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>•	2AFC and 6AFC Paradigms: In the 2AFC (Two-Alternative Forced Choice) task, participants had to choose between two options—essentially deciding which of two spots had the target. 
                    In the 6AFC (Six-Alternative Forced Choice) task, they chose from six spots, which was considered more challenging.</li>
                <li>•	Continuous Serial Search: In this task, participants looked at a grid of 28 patches and had to identify as many targets as possible by moving their eyes over them. 
                    This task was more complex and tested their ability to search through a crowded space.</li>
            </ul>
