                        In our day-to-day lives, we experience rapidly changing environments cluttered with information of all types. 
                        Just as when you have too many tabs open in Google Chrome, this information can have big implications on performance.
                        Within vision, this performance reduction can be seen as a worsened ability to perceive objects accurately. 
                        In cluttered environments, this can impede our ability to recognise specific objects. This phenomenon is known 
                        as ‘visual crowding’, and it’s most impactful within outer regions of vision, or peripheral vision. For 
                        instance, <b><em>Figure 1</em></b> gives a nice demonstration of visual crowding at play. When looking 
                        straight at the target in the centre of the image, it is much easier to notice the child on the right of 
                        the screen, who is in the open, rather than the child surrounded by road signs. This example shows how 
                        crowding can play a role in daily tasks such as driving.

                        </figure>
                        Whilst visual crowding is not an issue for most individuals, it can become of concern for those experiencing 
                        certain visual or brain-related deficits. Namely dyslexia, schizophrenia, nystagmus, macular degeneration and
                        glaucoma (1). In such individuals, crowding effects are more pronounced, and can negatively impact day-to-day life. 
                        It can lead to issues in reading speeds for dyslexic individuals (2), and issues in face recognition for individuals 
                        with glaucoma (3).
                        These challenges highlight the need to increase our understanding of visual crowding, so we can tailor current 
                        treatments and diagnoses towards these issues. Such would be a welcomed change, as currently there is a heavy 
                        reliance on time-consuming and attentionally demanding techniques. This reliance on demanding techniques becomes 
                        an issue when assessing certain patient groups who tend to struggle under conventional psychophysics techniques 
                        (4). Conventional techniques typically involve presenting a visual stimulus and expecting a response which can 
                        become over-demanding due to prolonged focus on singular objects, or even too many repetitions/responses needed.

            <h2>The Study</h2>
            <div class="intro-container-temp">

                    <p><br>
                        Our study aims to solve the aforementioned issues. We will investigate visual crowding to find a more intuitive 
                        and efficient method of testing for crowding effects, which is also suited for patient groups. If successful in 
                        this goal, we can provide a more effective method of assessing early indicators of visual impairment in various 
                        disorders. In turn, this can allow for necessary treatment to be given at an earlier stage, due to earlier diagnosis. 
                        One of our main ideas in reaching this goal is to move towards a task employing eye movement analysis. Whilst eye 
                        tracking gives a range of metrics surrounding visual functioning, we mainly want to implement eye tracking as a 
                        response mechanism. This would replace the need for a manual ‘button press’ typically seen in traditional approaches. 
                        Instead, participants would make a ‘saccade’ (rapid eye movement) towards a target, indicating a response. We believe 
                        this implementation of eye movements will allow for a freer and more natural experience for participants. Another way 
                        we aim to improve on traditional methods is by reducing the number of repetitions needed. As mentioned, psychophysical 
                        experiments typically require large amounts of repetition to gain necessary information. However, in our study, we will 
                        employ an adaptive psychophysics approach where the experiment dynamically changes difficulty based on an individual's 
                        performance on the task. This is a clever approach which allows for fewer repetitions to collect necessary information, 
                        thus reducing the overall length of the experiment.   
                    <p><br>
                        Ultimately, our primary focus is to develop an innovative, efficient, and adaptive psychophysics task to measure visual 
                        crowding. To investigate the effectiveness of using eye movement responses, we aim to introduce different ‘visual search’ 
                        paradigms to either promote continuous eye movement responses or not. A ‘serial search’ paradigm will be implemented to 
                        promote eye movements, whilst a ‘parallel search’ paradigm will be implemented to minimise eye movements. These paradigms 
                        are a part of ‘visual search’ which denotes the methods used to analyse a visual environment. ‘Serial search’ is an 
                        inefficient searching mechanism requiring individual inspection of objects to find the target, usually adopted in situations 
                        where an object of interest doesn’t stand out from its background. On the other hand, ‘parallel search’ is a more efficient 
                        mechanism which compares multiple objects at once, and is adopted when an object does stand out from its background. By 
                        employing a ‘serial search’ paradigm in our study, we can be more sure that continuous eye movements will be present since 
                        all objects will likely be searched independently.
